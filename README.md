# Intern_Theory
 Intern_theory.com is an online community and resource center created to help students, young professionals, and recent graduates find internships and start their careers. Through a variety of online tools, such as blogs, videos, and podcasts, Intern_theory.com provides resources for self-development and career exploration. The site also offers resources for employers, including job postings, resume review, and advice for hiring interns.
